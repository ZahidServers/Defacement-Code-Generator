# Defacement Code Generator — Demo & Templates (Educational)
**Defacement Code Generator** is a browser-based visual generator for retro “hacker” / defacement-style page templates meant **for educational use, demos and security labs only**.  
Use it to learn front-end effects (gradients, marquee, animated text, scrambles, GIFs, music) and to build safe mock pages for authorized security testing or art projects.
> ⚠️ **Important — Educational Use Only**  
> Do **not** use generated pages to attack, harass, or deface third-party websites. Only test against systems you own or are explicitly authorized to test (e.g., `localhost`, staging, or purpose-built labs).
